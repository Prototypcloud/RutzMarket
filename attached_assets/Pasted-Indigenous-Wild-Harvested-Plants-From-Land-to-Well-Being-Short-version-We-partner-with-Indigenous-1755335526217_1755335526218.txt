Indigenous Wild-Harvested Plants: From Land to Well-Being

Short version: We partner with Indigenous communities to bring wild plants and fungi—from their natural habitats, not farms—into safe, high-quality wellness products. Everything we do starts with consent, fair benefit-sharing, and care for the land.

What “Indigenous Wild Harvest” Means

Indigenous wild harvest is the community-led collection of non-cultivated plants and fungi from their home ecosystems. It is:

Led by Indigenous knowledge-holders with Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC).

Fair and transparent, with Access-and-Benefit-Sharing (ABS): communities share in decisions, data, and revenue.

Sustainable by design, following Good Agricultural and Collection Practices (GACP) and habitat-protection rules.

Traceable end-to-end, so every batch can be followed from place of origin to finished product.

Why it matters: Wild foods and medicines are rich in natural compounds, shaped by climate and soil. They also carry cultural meaning—food, ceremony, and health are connected. Honouring that connection leads to better products and better outcomes.

How We Work (Our Principles)

Rights & relationships first
Communities decide what is shared, how it’s used, and how benefits flow back.

Two ways of knowing
Indigenous knowledge and modern science work side-by-side—from choosing species to testing and formulation.

Sustainable harvests
Rotations, no-take zones, and species monitoring protect biodiversity. Collector safety matters, too.

Quality and safety at every step
Correct species ID (including DNA checks when needed), validated lab tests for key compounds, contaminant limits, and stability testing.

Clear, responsible claims
We follow the rules in each country. Traditional-use stories are shared respectfully; stronger claims require stronger evidence.

From Forest to Finished Goods: What We Make
A) Dietary / Food Supplements (core nutraceuticals)

Standardized extract capsules, tablets, softgels

Powders and drink mixes

Gummies/chews

Tinctures (hydroethanolic or glycerite)

Single-herb or polyherbal blends that reflect traditional formulations

B) Functional Foods & Beverages

Ready-to-drink (RTD) shots: adaptogenic, nootropic, digestive

Bars, granolas, fortified snacks

Fermented products where culture and science support it

Microencapsulated actives for bakery, dairy, or alt-protein

C) Medical Foods / Foods for Special Medical Purposes (FSMP)

Nutrition products for people with specific needs, used under clinician supervision and built to a stricter regulatory standard

D) Cosmeceuticals / Nutricosmetics

Beauty-from-within supplements for skin, hair, and nails

Topical adjuncts when traditional practice supports external use (a natural line extension)

E) Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products / Listed Medicines

Pathways differ by country (e.g., EU traditional herbal registrations, Australia listed medicines, Canada natural health products, India AYUSH/FSSAI). We choose the route that fits the evidence, claims, and intended use.

What Makes These Ingredients Special

Biocultural roots: Products are connected to place, language, and practice—not just to chemistry.

Phytochemical richness: Wild plants often produce higher or more diverse beneficial compounds.

Full transparency: Co-branding with communities, clear sourcing, and open quality data build trust.

Regulation-ready: We plan for safety, quality, and labeling from day one.

Safety & Quality You Can See

Verified species and origin

Lab-tested markers (e.g., polyphenols, essential oils, polysaccharides)

Screens for heavy metals, pesticides, microbes, and allergens

Stable potency through shelf life

Plain-language labels that match what’s inside

Reminder: Wellness products aren’t a substitute for medical care. If you have a health condition, talk to your healthcare professional.

Our Promise to Communities and Land

Fair benefits: revenue share, jobs, training, and co-ownership of data where agreed

Shared governance: community voices at the decision table

Stewardship: harvesting that protects species and habitats for generations

People. Planet. Tradition. Science. That’s the path from wild harvest to well-being.
