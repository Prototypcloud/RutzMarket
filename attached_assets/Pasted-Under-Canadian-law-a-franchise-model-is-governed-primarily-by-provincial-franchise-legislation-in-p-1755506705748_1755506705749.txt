Under Canadian law, a franchise model is governed primarily by provincial franchise legislation in provinces like Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba, British Columbia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island. In provinces without specific franchise statutes, the common law and general contract principles apply.
Here’s how Beyond Nature Ltd. could structure its franchise model:

1. Legal Foundation
Franchise Agreement: Sets out rights, obligations, and brand standards.
Disclosure Document: Required in regulated provinces; must be given at least 14 days before signing.
Trademark Licensing: Secure IP rights (logos, processes, trade dress).
Operations Manual: Detailed procedures for harvesting, production, sales, and community engagement.

2. Franchise Structure
Master Franchise Model (for Indigenous-led or regional operators): A master franchisee manages sub-franchisees in a territory.
Single Unit Franchise: A local operator runs one harvesting and processing location.
Area Development Agreement: Grants rights to open multiple units in a region.

3. Possible Fee Structure
A. Initial Franchise Fee
Covers training, onboarding, brand rights, and initial setup.
For Beyond Nature’s niche (social impact + wellness exports), a CAD $25,000 – $50,000 range is realistic, depending on territory size and exclusivity.
B. Ongoing Royalties
Typically 5–8% of gross revenue.
Could be a reduced royalty for Indigenous-owned franchisees to align with social purpose.
C. Marketing/Brand Fund Contribution
1–3% of gross sales to a pooled fund for national/international marketing.
D. Social Impact Contribution
Fixed % of revenue (e.g., 1–2%) earmarked for community benefit projects in Indigenous communities.
E. Administration/Management Fee
If Beyond Nature manages operations directly (turnkey model), charge a management fee of 8–12% of revenue in addition to royalties.

4. Additional Considerations
Training Costs: May be billed separately if advanced or specialized.
Supply Chain Margin: Beyond Nature can generate profit through bulk purchasing and resale of specialized equipment or inputs.
Quality Control Audits: Could be billed annually or built into royalties.

5. Compliance & Risk
Must comply with provincial franchise acts where applicable.
Ensure cultural IP protection in agreements with Indigenous partners.
Include clear dispute resolution clauses (mediation/arbitration).
